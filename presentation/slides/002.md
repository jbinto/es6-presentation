# Transpilation and Babel

* transpile (v): word invented by JavaScript thought leaders; meaning compile
* Browser support is all over the map for most of ES2015, thus the need for a build step
* Not all features can be transpiled. Some require browser engine changes\*
* Some features require runtime support via `babel-polyfill`


\* (proxies, tail call optimization, subclassing certain built-ins)

# ES6? ES2015? ES2016? TC39? WTF?

* ECMAxxScript a.k.a. JavaScript hasn't been updated since 2011
* ES6 was a big push to get JS modernized, and was a lot to chew at once
* ES6 has 12 "large features"\*, and dozens of more medium/minor features
* Renamed to ES2015, and subsequent versions will be ES201[6789]

\* (modules, spread operator, object literal extensions, for..of loops, template literals, arrow functions, class, generators, typed arrays, Promise, Symbol)
